## General Information
- The lending club case study is a project to find out to which customer the company must provide loans.

- The company need to come to a conclusion that to whom should they provide the loans.
- The dataset is the data provided by the company.

## Conclusions
- Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure so that more people take the 60 months tenure and ultimately it generates more revenue as there is a time period difference.
- Grades are good indication for detecting defaulters. Lending club should examine more information  from borrowers before issuing loans to Low grade (G to A).
- More loans and less interest rate should be provided to small business category because that is when more revenue will be generated and GDP of a country goes up eventually increasing the currency value and the stock prices of the company and more returns come back to you.
-  More loans and less interest rate should be provided to housing loans because housing loans can vary from 1 to 30 years and if less interest rate is provided eventually on a long term the company can make money.
